## Netlify CMS
I love that Netlify CMS allows you to just go to the /admin page and type up a quick post that will be pushed to your Github repo and then will be built with a git hook. Very cool. Netlify also handles all of the authentication through your personal Github and Netlify Identity allows you to invite other users to join, who can login through Google.

## Tina CMS
The next CMS I want to look into is Tina... stay tuned!
